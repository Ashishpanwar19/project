# Data Visualization Dashboard

This project is a data visualization dashboard built using Flask and SQL for backend and a frontend framework (D3.js, Chart.js, or similar) for interactive charts and visualizations. The project uses a given JSON dataset (`jsondata.json`) to create a dynamic, filterable dashboard.

## Project Structure

- **Backend**: Flask for API and database interaction
- **Database**: SQL for data storage and querying
- **Frontend**: JavaScript with a visualization library (D3.js, Chart.js, or Plotly.js)
- **Data**: JSON file (`jsondata.json`) containing variables such as Intensity, Likelihood, Relevance, Year, Country, Topics, Region, and City

## Features

1. **Data Loading and Database Creation**
   - The JSON data is loaded into a SQL database for efficient querying and storage.

2. **Backend API**
   - Built using Flask to interact with the database.
   - APIs provide endpoints to retrieve data for visualizations and filters.

3. **Frontend Dashboard**
   - Developed using JavaScript and a charting library (e.g., D3.js, Chart.js, or Plotly.js).
   - Includes interactive visualizations and graphs.

4. **Filtering Options**
   - End year
   - Topics
   - Sector
   - Region
   - PEST
   - Source
   - SWOT
   - Country
   - City

5. **Visualized Variables**
   - Intensity
   - Likelihood
   - Relevance
   - Year
   - Country
   - Topics
   - Region
   - City

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- SQL Database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- JavaScript and a charting library (e.g., D3.js, Chart.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Database Setup**:
   - Load the JSON data into your SQL database.
   - Update the database connection details in the Flask application.

4. **Run the Flask API**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Open `index.html` in your preferred web server or set up a local server to serve the frontend files.

## Usage

- Access the dashboard in your browser.
- Use the filters on the dashboard to explore and analyze the data interactively.
